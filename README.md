This project is a responsive Income & Expense Tracker application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete financial transactions (both income and expenses) and keeps a running balance of their net income.


Features

1.Add New Transactions: Users can add income or expense entries by providing a description, amount, and selecting the transaction type (income or expense).

2.Edit Existing Transactions: Each entry can be edited, allowing the user to update details of the transaction.

3.Delete Transactions: Users can remove transactions from the list.

4.Filter Transactions: Users can filter the displayed transactions by "All", "Income", or "Expenses".

5.Calculate Totals: Displays the total income, total expenses, and the net balance dynamically.

6.Local Storage: The transactions are saved to the browser's local storage, so the data persists even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

7.Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the app is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
